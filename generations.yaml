    description: "The Chevrolet Blazer EV is the brand's first electric mid-size SUV, built on GM's dedicated Ultium EV platform. The exterior design features an aggressive, futuristic interpretation of the combustion-engine Blazer's styling cues with a dramatic front lighting signature, muscular proportions, and a sleek, aerodynamic profile. Unlike many EVs that share a single powertrain across trim levels, the Blazer EV offers remarkable diversity with FWD, RWD, and AWD configurations available across different trims. The performance-oriented SS model delivers 557 HP and 648 lb-ft of torque, enabling 0-60 mph acceleration in under 4 seconds with the WOW (Wide Open Watts) mode. Battery capacity varies by model, with the largest pack offering an EPA-estimated range of up to 324 miles in the rear-wheel drive configuration. The interior showcases a tech-focused design centered around a 17.7-inch touchscreen infotainment system and an 11-inch digital instrument cluster, with ambient lighting and contrasting color schemes creating a futuristic yet familiar environment. Charging capabilities include DC fast charging at up to 190 kW, allowing approximately 78 miles of range to be added in 10 minutes. The Blazer EV serves as a key model in Chevrolet's electric vehicle strategy, offering a versatile, stylish option positioned between the compact Equinox EV and the larger Silverado EV pickup, demonstrating GM's commitment to electrification across various segments and price points."
